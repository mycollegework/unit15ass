        <h2>Company Profile</h2>
        <p>Hot Beans Web was established in 2007 by David Wood, who previously held roles in a multi-national business. He saw that there was a potential for a slightly different type of Web Design Agency;
            David wanted to create a web design agency that could deliver on the fundamentals of providing good quality websites at affordable prices without compromising on quality.
            Over a decade and a half later, it has proven to be a successful formula; we have seen the business grow year on year for both Hot Beans and our clients. We have our head office in Peterborough and offices in Northampton.<br>
            
            Our Trusting Clients<br>
            Our clients base include many different types and sizes of business, ranging from the sole trader to SME's all the way through to household names.<br>
            Hot Beans has had direct and indirect development contracts with some of the world's biggest names, including the likes of Belkin, DSG Group, Ingram Micro, Halfords, Nationwide, and Tesco.
            However, our favourite customers are the ones that embrace a website to help start and develop their businesses. These include local plumbers, builders, electricians, home builders and gardeners.
            We are always here to help and believe in Givers Gain; if you need any help or advice, we are here to help, and we donâ€™t charge for any consultation ever!<br>
