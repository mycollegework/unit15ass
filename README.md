As a Junior Web Developer, I have produced designs which are relevant to the client requirements. 
● A profile of the company itself
● profiles of existing trainee web developers
● job specifications and required qualifications
● an on-line application form
● links to web development courses
Based on the client requirements, I have thought and created a well design which ensures that it includes all the details necessary to fulfill the client requirements. To produce the designs, I have created wireframes with the structure and design of what each website page would look like.
